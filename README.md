# State Management

Simple 3 layer project used to exemplify state management using the Provider package.

Things to pay attention:

*'ChangeNotifierProvider' on the root of the widget tree -
which allows for the rest of the three to see data and react to changes coming from the Provider.

*'notifyListeners()' use to send a flag to all listeners to rebuild.

It is a simply project, easy enough to understand what is going on and to play around with.

    More details through the code.
